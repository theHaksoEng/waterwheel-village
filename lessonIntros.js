        "In Waterwheel Village, many of us remember times when food was not safe or not enough. That is why we share. A neighbour brings apples. I give her some hot soup. Around the table, people relax. Warm food and warm words make hearts softer.\n\n" +
        "Now, [name], I would like to hear about you. What do you eat in the morning? What do you like to drink during the day? You can write something simple like: 'For breakfast I eat ...' or 'I like to drink ...' Use easy words, and I will help you make them clear."

She is very old now, but when she starts to talk, everyone is quiet. We all sit around the table, like one big family.\n\n" +

        "At midday I stop. I wash my hands, drink tea, and eat with my wife and children. After lunch, I fix small things around the house — a door handle, a broken bucket, or sometimes I help a neighbour sharpen his tools. These little jobs are not heavy, but they are important. They make the day complete.\n\n" +
        "In the evening, I close the forge and clean my tools. The hammer must rest too. Before I sleep, I often walk by the river. The sound of water reminds me that even small things — drops, sparks, chores — can make something strong over time.\n\n" +

        "Inside, I read the menu slowly. There is soup, salad, bread, and a warm dish of the day. The waiter comes and smiles.\n\n" +
        "'What would you like?' he asks.\n" +
        "'I would like the soup and some bread, please,' I say.\n" +
        "'Anything to drink?'\n" +
        "'Yes, a glass of water.'\n\n" +
        "After the meal I say, 'The food was delicious. Thank you.' Then I ask, 'Can I have the bill, please?'\n\n" +
        "Many people in this village remember times when they ate quickly, in noisy halls or crowded stations. Here, a quiet meal in a café can feel like a small miracle.\n\n" +
        "With just a few polite phrases, eating in a restaurant becomes easy and calm.\n\n" +
        "Now, [name], think of a meal you would order. Write a short dialogue, for example:\n" +
        "'I would like chicken and rice, please.'\n" +
        "'A glass of juice, please.'\n" +
        "I will help you make your restaurant English friendly and natural."

      story:
        "In my classroom, I sometimes see a student who is pale and quiet. Their eyes look heavy.\n\n" +
        "I ask gently, 'How do you feel today?'\n" +
        "They answer, 'I am tired. I have a headache.'\n\n" +
        "Simple words for the body help us ask for help. Head, stomach, back, throat, leg, arm. Pain, tired, cold, hot. When we can name the problem, others can understand.\n\n" +
        "In the evening I walk by the river for exercise. My heart beats a little faster, my lungs fill with fresh air, and my mind becomes calmer. Good health is not only no sickness. It is also rest, good food, movement, and kindness to ourselves.\n\n" +
        "Many people here arrived exhausted, after long journeys. Step by step, we rebuild not only houses but also bodies and strength.\n\n" +
        "Now, [name], tell me about your body today. Are you tired, full of energy, a little stressed, or relaxed? You can write: 'I feel tired. My back hurts,' or 'I feel good today.' I will help you with the words."

        "In Waterwheel Village, the clinic is small but warm. There are a few chairs, a table with magazines, and a pot of tea for waiting people.\n\n" +
        "A mother comes in with her child.\n" +
        "'What is the problem?' I ask.\n" +
        "She says, 'He has a fever and a cough.'\n\n" +
        "I listen to his chest, check his throat, and take his temperature. I speak slowly so the mother understands:\n" +
        "'It is only a small infection. He needs rest, water, and this medicine.'\n\n" +
        "In another room, an old man sits with back pain. A young woman comes with a toothache. Each person brings their own story, their own pain, sometimes from many years ago.\n\n" +
        "At the clinic, simple English can be very important:\n" +
        "'I have pain here.'\n" +
        "'I feel sick.'\n" +
        "'I need a doctor.'\n" +

        "When I help plan Waterwheel Village, I do not only think about houses. I think about the spaces between them — where people meet, wait, rest, and help each other.\n\n" +
        "We pass the post office, where letters arrive from far away. For many villagers, a letter means news from a country they had to leave.\n\n" +
        "We see the bank, where people keep money safe. We see the library, full of books in many languages. In the park, children play while older people sit on benches and talk.\n\n" +
        "Near the square there is a small police station and a fire station. I hope we never need them, but I am glad they are there. The hospital and clinic stand on the hill, quiet but ready.\n\n" +
        "These buildings are like organs in the body of the village. Together they keep us safe, connected, and alive.\n\n" +
        "Now, [name], think about your town or area. What important places are there? A school, a shop, a bus stop, a park? Write a few sentences, like: 'Near my home there is a park and a supermarket.' I will help you with the English names."

      story:
        "Most days in Waterwheel Village are calm. The loudest sounds are children playing and birds singing. But sometimes something serious happens.\n\n" +
        "A house catches fire. A person falls and cannot stand up. A child disappears for a moment in the crowd.\n\n" +
        "In these moments, we do not need long sentences. We need clear words:\n" +
        "'Help!'\n" +
        "'Call an ambulance!'\n" +
        "'Call the police!'\n" +
        "'There is a fire!'\n\n" +
        "Many people here remember nights when there were sirens, shouting, and fear. That is why we practise strong, simple phrases when we are safe, so they are ready when we are afraid.\n\n" +
        "We also need gentle words:\n" +
        "'Stay calm.'\n" +
        "'You are safe now.'\n" +
        "'I am here with you.'\n\n" +
        "Sometimes I add a quiet prayer, but the first help is always clear action and clear language.\n\n" +

        "Back in my homeland, the year was shaped by rain and sun. Here in Waterwheel Village, the seasons are different, but the sky still speaks.\n\n" +
        "In spring, the ground wakes up. Snow melts, and small green leaves appear. In summer, the days are long and bright, and children play by the river until late.\n\n" +
        "In autumn, the fields turn golden and the air becomes cool. In winter, the world is quiet under snow and ice. The first winter was hard for many of us who came from warmer lands, but step by step we learned new words: frost, slippery, freezing.\n\n" +
        "When we have words for weather and seasons, we can say more than 'good' or 'bad' weather. We can say 'foggy', 'stormy', 'warm', 'freezing', and explain how we feel.\n\n" +

        "Near Waterwheel Village there are tall pine trees, soft moss, and fields where we grow food together. Deer move quietly between the trees. Foxes watch from far away. In the river, fish swim and ducks rest near the shore.\n\n" +
        "In my country, I learned that if you respect the land, it gives back. Here we use compost, save water, and try not to waste. We also clean the river banks together, because this place is now home for all of us.\n\n" +
        "We learn words for animals and plants not only for tests, but so we can love and protect them.\n\n" +
        "Now, [name], think of a place in nature that you like: a forest, a lake, a park, a field. What do you see there? Trees, birds, flowers, animals? Write a few simple sentences, like: 'Near my home there is a small forest with tall trees.' I will help you with the words."

        "In winter we gather in warm rooms with candles and hot drinks. We sing old songs — some Finnish, some from other lands. In spring we celebrate light returning. In summer we dance outside under the open sky. In autumn we thank the earth for its food.\n\n" +
        "Every family has its own traditions: birthday cakes, special meals, quiet visits to the graveyard, long phone calls with far-away relatives. Some people here have lost family members. For them, a celebration is also a time to remember and to cry a little in peace.\n\n" +
        "There is no 'right' or 'wrong' tradition. There are only different ways of showing love, memory, and hope.\n\n" +
        "Now, [name], think of one celebration or tradition that is important to you. It can be big or small. Write about it in simple English: 'On this day, we ...' or 'My family always ...' I will listen and help you find the words."

        "Now, [name], I invite you to write a short story about one normal day, or one important day in your life. Use any words you remember from our months together. Do not worry about mistakes. Just write. I will help you shape your story, step by step."
