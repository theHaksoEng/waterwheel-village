    greetings_introductions: {
      teacher: "mcarthur",
      text: `Welcome, [name]. I am Mr. McArthur, the village elder here in Waterwheel Village. Today we will take gentle first steps with greetings and introductions.`,
      story: `On your first morning in Waterwheel Village, the sun is low and soft. You walk to the village square. People are busy, but their faces are kind.

At the bakery door, a woman smiles and says, "Hello." An old man adds, "Good morning." You answer quietly, "Hello... good morning." It feels simple, but also important.

You hear other voices around you:
"Hi!"
"Good afternoon!"
"Good evening!"
"Good night."

A young boy comes to you and says, "My name is Sami. What is your name?" You answer, "My name is [name]. Nice to meet you, Sami." He laughs and says, "Nice to meet you too."

Later, as the day ends, you walk home. You say, "Goodbye" to the shopkeeper and "See you later" to the children playing near the river. These small greetings open many doors in the village.

Now, [name], let us practice together. Please introduce yourself in simple English. You can write: "Hello, my name is [name]. I am from ..." and maybe add, "Nice to meet you." I will help you.`,

    numbers_days_questions: {
      teacher: "johannes",
      text: `Good day, [name]. I am Johannes, the farmer. Today we will count together and talk about days and simple questions.`,
      story: `Early in the morning, I stand by my field and look at the rows of plants. One, two, three, four. I count them slowly. Numbers help me plan my work.

In my small kitchen there is a calendar on the wall:
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

Some days I plant seeds. Some days I rest. On Sunday I try to be quiet and thankful.

A neighbor comes and asks me, "Johannes, what day is it today?"
I smile and say, "Today is Tuesday."
He points to the sky and asks, "Will it rain tomorrow?"
"Maybe," I say. "Yes, maybe. But today, no rain."

We look at the plants together.
"How many rows do you have, Johannes?"
"I have ten rows this year."
"How many hours do you work in one day?"
"Sometimes eight, sometimes ten."

Simple questions help us share our days:
"What day is it today?"
"What time do you start work?"
"When do you rest?"

Now, [name], I would like to know about your days. What day is easy for you? What day is difficult? You can write something simple like: "Today is Monday. I go to school" or "On Sunday I rest." Ask me one short question too, for example: "What day do you like?"`,

    food_drink: {
      teacher: "fatima",
      text: `Hello, [name]. I am Fatima, the healer in Waterwheel Village. Today we talk about food and drink, slowly and kindly.`,
      story: `In my house, the day begins in the kitchen. The smell of fresh bread fills the air. My children sit at the small table and wait.

"Would you like some tea?" I ask my husband.
"Yes, please," he answers with a smile.
I pour tea into his cup and say, "Here you are."
"Thank you," he says softly.

The children drink milk and eat bread with a little honey. One child is still sleepy. He says, "I am hungry." Another laughs and says, "I am thirsty. Can I have some water?"

We use small, polite words again and again:
"Please."
"Thank you."
"Excuse me."
"Sorry."

At midday, there is soup on the stove and rice in a big pot. In the evening, the house smells of garlic and onions. Sometimes we eat simple food: bread, cheese, salad, fruit. Sometimes I make a sweet cake when someone has a birthday.

In Waterwheel Village, we often share food. A neighbor brings apples. I give her some hot soup. Around the table, people relax. Warm food and warm words make hearts softer.

Now, [name], I would like to hear about you. What do you eat in the morning? What do you like to drink during the day? You can write something simple like: "For breakfast I eat..." or "I like to drink..." Use easy words, and I will help you make them clear.`,

    daily_phrases: {
      teacher: "anika",
      text: `Hi, [name]. I am Anika, the seamstress. Today we will practice small daily phrases that make life smoother, like good stitches in cloth.`,
      story: `My workshop in Waterwheel Village is full of color. Pieces of fabric hang on the wall. The sound of scissors and thread is like quiet music.

People come in and out all day. I hear many small phrases:
"Good morning."
"Please."
"Thank you."
"Excuse me."
"Sorry."

A neighbor opens the door and says, "Excuse me, Anika. Can you help me with my coat?"
"Yes, of course. Come in. Please sit down," I answer.
When I finish the repair, she smiles and says, "Thank you very much."
I say, "You are welcome. No problem."

Sometimes a new person comes and is shy. They say, "I don't understand." I slow down and repeat: "No problem. I can say it again." We practice short phrases together:
"Can you repeat, please?"
"One moment."
"That is good."
"Very good."

These small sentences are like strong stitches. They hold a conversation together, even when your English is simple.

Now, [name], let us sew some phrases into your day. Write two or three short sentences you can use often. For example: "Excuse me, I don't understand," or "Please, can you help me?" I will help you make them natural.`,

  month2: {
    family_members: {
      teacher: "fatima",
      text: `Hello, [name]. I am Fatima, the healer of Waterwheel Village. Today we talk about something very close to my heart: family.`,
      story: `Here in Waterwheel Village, families are close. I live in a small yellow house near the river with my husband and our three children. 
In the morning, my husband makes tea while I wake up the children. Our daughter helps her little brother find his socks, and our oldest son walks the dog. It is noisy, but it is a good noise.

Every Sunday my parents come to visit us. My mother always brings fresh bread, and my father tells stories from our old home far away. Sometimes my grandmother also comes. She is very old now, but when she starts to talk, everyone is quiet. We all sit around the table, like one big family.

Our neighbours feel like family too. The boy next door plays football with our children. The woman from across the road comes for tea when she feels lonely. In this village, when someone is sad or tired, we do not leave them alone. We visit, we listen, we cook, we help.

Now I would like to hear about you, [name]. Who is in your family? Do you live alone, or with your parents, children, or someone else? Tell me in simple English first, and I will help you.`
